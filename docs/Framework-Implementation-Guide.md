## 📁 **Step 1: Copy the Framework (2 minutes)**

### **What to Copy to Your New Project:**
```
📁 YourNewProject/
├── 📁 agents/                    # ✅ Copy as-is (no changes needed)
│   └── executor.ts               
├── 📁 config/                    # ✅ Copy as-is  
│   └── config-manager.ts         
├── 📁 cli/                       # ✅ Copy as-is
│   └── executor-cli.ts           
├── 📁 docs/                      # ✅ Copy all documentation
├── 📁 prompts/                   # 🔄 Replace with your test files
├── 📁 test-data/                 # 🔄 Replace with your data files

copy "Playwright MCP_Executor Agent\playwright.config.ts" "YourProject\"
copy "Playwright MCP_Executor Agent\tsconfig.json" "YourProject\"
```

## ⚙️ **Step 2: Create Your Application Configuration (3 minutes)**

### **The Only File You Need to Create:**
Create `config/app-configs/your-app.json`

### **Example: E-commerce Application**
```json
{
  "name": "MyEcommerce",
  "version": "1.0.0", 
  "description": "Configuration for MyEcommerce application testing",
  "baseUrl": "https://your-ecommerce-site.com",
  "defaultCredentials": {
    "username": "test@example.com",
    "password": "yourPassword123"
  },
  "elements": {
    "loginPage": {
      "emailInput": "email address input field",
      "passwordInput": "password input field", 
      "loginButton": "sign in button",
      "forgotPassword": "forgot password link"
    },
    "navigation": {
      "homeLink": "home navigation link",
      "cartIcon": "shopping cart icon",
      "searchBox": "product search box",
      "userMenu": "user account menu"
    },
    "productPage": {
      "addToCartButton": "add to cart button",
      "quantitySelector": "quantity dropdown",
      "productImage": "product image",
      "priceDisplay": "product price text"
    },
    "checkout": {
      "checkoutButton": "proceed to checkout button",
      "shippingForm": "shipping address form",
      "paymentSection": "payment method section",
      "placeOrderButton": "place order button"
    }
  },
  "testContext": "You are testing MyEcommerce, an online retail platform. The application includes product browsing, cart management, user accounts, and checkout processing. Focus on customer purchase workflows and account management features.",
  "environment": {
    "timeout": 45000,
    "retries": 3,
    "browsers": ["chromium", "firefox"],
    "headless": false
  }
}
```

### **Example: Banking Application**  
```json
{
  "name": "SecureBank",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Configuration for SecureBank application testing", 
  "baseUrl": "https://your-banking-app.com",
  "defaultCredentials": {
    "username": "testuser123",
    "password": "securePass456"
  },
  "elements": {
    "loginPage": {
      "userIdInput": "user ID input field",
      "passwordInput": "password input field",
      "loginButton": "login button",
      "securityQuestions": "security questions section"
    },
    "dashboard": {
      "accountSummary": "account summary section", 
      "quickActions": "quick actions panel",
      "transactionHistory": "recent transactions list",
      "balanceDisplay": "account balance display"
    },
    "transfers": {
      "fromAccount": "from account dropdown",
      "toAccount": "to account dropdown", 
      "amountInput": "transfer amount input",
      "transferButton": "transfer funds button",
      "confirmDialog": "confirmation dialog"
    }
  },
  "testContext": "You are testing SecureBank, a comprehensive online banking platform. The application includes account management, fund transfers, bill payments, and transaction history. Focus on secure financial workflows and regulatory compliance features.",
  "environment": {
    "timeout": 60000,
    "retries": 2,
    "browsers": ["chromium"],
    "headless": false
  }
}
```

### **🔑 Key Configuration Rules:**

1. **baseUrl** - Your application's main URL
2. **defaultCredentials** - Test account credentials  
3. **elements** - Use **human-readable descriptions**, NOT CSS selectors
4. **testContext** - Guide the AI about your application's purpose
5. **environment** - Adjust timeouts and browsers for your needs

## ✍️ **Step 3: Write Your Test Prompts (5 minutes)**

### **Create Natural Language Test Files in `prompts/` folder:**

#### **Example: E-commerce Purchase Flow**
```
Title: Complete Purchase Workflow
Priority: P1
Tags: e2e, purchase, critical

Test Steps:
1. Navigate to the ecommerce application
2. Login with valid test credentials  
3. Search for "laptop" in the search box
4. Click on the first product from search results
5. Select quantity as 2
6. Click add to cart button
7. Verify cart shows 2 items
8. Click proceed to checkout button
9. Fill shipping address with test data
10. Select payment method as "Credit Card"
11. Click place order button
12. Verify order confirmation page appears

Expected Results:
- User can successfully complete purchase workflow
- Cart updates correctly with selected quantity
- Order confirmation displays after successful purchase
```

#### **Example: Banking Transfer Test**
```
Title: Fund Transfer Between Accounts
Priority: P1 
Tags: banking, transfer, smoke

Test Steps:
1. Navigate to the banking application
2. Login with valid credentials
3. Navigate to fund transfer section  
4. Select "Checking" as from account
5. Select "Savings" as to account
6. Enter transfer amount as $100.00
7. Click transfer funds button
8. Confirm transfer in confirmation dialog
9. Verify transfer success message appears
10. Check transaction history shows the transfer

Expected Results:
- Transfer completes successfully between accounts
- Confirmation message displays
- Transaction appears in history with correct details
```

## 🚀 **Step 4: Install and Run (1 minute)**

### **Installation:**
```bash
cd YourProject
npm install
npx playwright install
```

### **Run Your First Test:**
```bash
# Method 1: Direct execution
ts-node agents/executor.ts --app=your-app --file=your-test.txt

# Method 2: Enhanced CLI 
ts-node cli/executor-cli.ts --app=your-app --file=purchase-workflow.txt

# Method 3: Add to package.json scripts
npm run test:your-app  # (after adding script)
```

---

## 🔧 **Step 5: Customize Package.json Scripts (Optional)**

### **Add Your Application Scripts:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "// Your Application Scripts": "",
    "test:ecommerce": "ts-node agents/executor.ts --app=ecommerce --file=purchase-workflow.txt --browsers=chromium,firefox",
    "test:banking": "ts-node agents/executor.ts --app=banking --file=fund-transfer.txt --browsers=chromium",
    "smoke:ecommerce": "ts-node agents/executor.ts --app=ecommerce --suite=smoke --browsers=chromium,firefox",
    "regression:banking": "ts-node agents/executor.ts --app=banking --suite=regression --browsers=chromium,firefox,webkit"
  }
}
```

## 🎉 **Success Metrics**

### **Immediate Benefits (Week 1):**
- ✅ Tests running on new applications
- ✅ Cross-browser coverage achieved  
- ✅ Natural language test creation

### **Short-term Benefits (Month 1):**
- ✅ Multiple applications using framework
- ✅ Team independence achieved
- ✅ Reduced test maintenance overhead  

### **Long-term Benefits (3+ Months):**
