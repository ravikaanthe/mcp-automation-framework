Generate a Playwright test in TypeScript that:
1. Opens https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com
2. Ask my permission to execute next steps
3. Logs in with Admin / admin123
   - If the username field locator is missing, try alternatives:
     * input with placeholder "Username"
     * label text "Username"
     * first text field before "Password"
   - Do the same for password and login button
4. Verifies the dashboard loads
5. Click on 'User' icon and select Logs out.
Ensure the script adapts if locators change.
