Generate a Playwright test in TypeScript using @playwright/test that performs data-driven testing with an external dataset.

Scenario: Login validation on https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com

Requirements:
1. Read test data from an external CSV file called "loginData.csv" located in the "test-data" folder.
   The file has the following columns: Username, Password, Expected.
   Example rows:
      Admin, admin123, Dashboard
      fakeuser, fakepass, Invalid credentials
      ESSUser1, ess123, Invalid credentials

2. For each row in the dataset:
   - Navigate to the OrangeHRM login page
   - Enter the Username and Password from the dataset
   - Click the Login button
   - Verify the Expected result:
       - If Expected = "Dashboard", check that the dashboard page is visible
       - If Expected = "Invalid credentials", check that the error message "Invalid credentials" is displayed

3. Implement iteration so that all rows in the dataset are tested automatically within one test suite.

4. Log pass/fail results for each dataset entry in the test output.

5. Close the browser after all tests complete.
